#given 3 sorted arrays find the common elements in them 
#we can check common elements in any 2 arrays and then we can check if that element is there in array 3 
# this approach will take O(n^2) complexity
#else we can make a dictionary of the 3 arrays and where every the value of a particular key is 3 we require those elements
