#given an array we need to find its inversion count 
#inversion count indicates that how far is the array from being sorted 
#brute force method will be Traverse through the array and for every index find the number of smaller elements on its right side of the array. 
#Sum up the counts for all index in the array and print the sum.
#complexity will be O(n^2)

#enhance merge sort
